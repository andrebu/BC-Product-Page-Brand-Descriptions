        <p class="brand-description">These awsome little bowl/slide holders will prevent that awful feeling of dropping a freshly packed slide on the ground. We've all been there, and the guys at 420Stands decided to do something about it. Made in a basement in California using a 3d Printer, these guys put their blood sweat and tears into individually printing each stand. Rest your dabber on the stand between hits to keep it from getting lint anall kinds of junk stuck to it. All 420 Stands are handmade and are uniquely different with naturally occurring bubbles and imperfections. While we think this makes them even more awesome, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you receive a stand you are not 100% happy with for whatever reason just contact us and we will take care of it. Return your stand within thirty (30) days and we will gladly exchange it for another color, size, or model. <a href="http://dankstop.com/brands/420-stands">Learn more about 420 Stands...</a>
