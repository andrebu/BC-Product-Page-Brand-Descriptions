Unlike most grinder companies that use sharp teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder uses square teeth. Sharp-edged teeth dull from metal fatigue and contain burr and tiny flakes of aluminum that can fall into your smoking blend. By using square teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder avoids this extremely unhealthy possibility. The grinders are &#x3C;span&#x3E;fabricated out of a single piece of high grade CNC aluminum to provide durability and a consistent grind. Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are totally scratch resistant through a process called Anodizing, which&#xA0;&#x3C;span&#x3E;creates a protective coating for aluminum that prevents wear resistance, failing of threaded parts, and corrosion.&#xA0;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;They use top-of-the-line magnets and screens. The magnets they use are Neodymium Diametrically Magnetized Cylindrical Rare Earth Magnets which create a triple layer of Nickel and Copper to prevent against corrosion and abuse. Santa Cruz Shredder uses T304 Microbic Precision Woven Non-Fraying Stainless Steel Screens which has a high micron size that allows less impurities to pass through into the pollen chamber.

The added airflow gives great heat retention while also providing a low temperature dab hit. \r Glass Domes → Glass domes come with standard glass, quartz, ceramic, and titanium nails. While the nail goes inside the joint, the glass dome goes over the joint and the nail. The purpose of glass domes is to confine vapor once concentrates are added to the heated nail. The design of domes ensures vapor doesn’t escape into the air and is instead all inhaled into the concentrate pipe."
