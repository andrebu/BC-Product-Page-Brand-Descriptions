Made in a basement in California using a 3D Printer, these guys put their blood, sweat, and tears into individually printing each stand. All 420 Stands are handmade and are uniquely different with naturally occurring bubbles and imperfections. This type of craftsmanship really distinguishes these stands to let you know that each one is handcrafted and meticulously made with an acute attention to detail. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/brands/420-stands&#x22;&#x3E;See more products from 420 Stands.&#x3C;/a&#x3E;"

Unlike most grinder companies that use sharp teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder uses square teeth. Sharp-edged teeth dull from metal fatigue and contain burr and tiny flakes of aluminum that can fall into your smoking blend. By using square teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder avoids this extremely unhealthy possibility. The grinders are &#x3C;span&#x3E;fabricated out of a single piece of high grade CNC aluminum to provide durability and a consistent grind. Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are totally scratch resistant through a process called Anodizing, which&#xA0;&#x3C;span&#x3E;creates a protective coating for aluminum that prevents wear resistance, failing of threaded parts, and corrosion.&#xA0;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;They use top-of-the-line magnets and screens. The magnets they use are Neodymium Diametrically Magnetized Cylindrical Rare Earth Magnets which create a triple layer of Nickel and Copper to prevent against corrosion and abuse. Santa Cruz Shredder uses T304 Microbic Precision Woven Non-Fraying Stainless Steel Screens which has a high micron size that allows less impurities to pass through into the pollen chamber.
