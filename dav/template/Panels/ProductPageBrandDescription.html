We&#x27;ve all been there, and the guys at 420 Stands decided to do something about it. 420 Stands also manufactures a &#x22;Dab Station&#x22;, which includes two compartments for your concentrate jars as well as a nice resting place for your &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/dabbers-carb-caps&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;dabber&#x3C;/a&#x3E; (to avoid lint and any type of surface materials that can get stuck to it). Made in a basement in California using a 3D Printer, these guys put their blood, sweat, and tears into individually printing each stand. All 420 Stands are handmade and are uniquely different with naturally occurring bubbles and imperfections. This type of craftsmanship really distinguishes these stands to let you know that each one is handcrafted and meticulously made with an acute attention to detail. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/brands/420-stands&#x22;&#x3E;See more products from 420 Stands.&#x3C;/a&#x3E;"

Unlike most grinder companies that use sharp teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder uses square teeth. Sharp-edged teeth dull from metal fatigue and contain burr and tiny flakes of aluminum that can fall into your smoking blend. By using square teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder avoids this extremely unhealthy possibility. The grinders are &#x3C;span&#x3E;fabricated out of a single piece of high grade CNC aluminum to provide durability and a consistent grind. Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are totally scratch resistant through a process called Anodizing, which&#xA0;&#x3C;span&#x3E;creates a protective coating for aluminum that prevents wear resistance, failing of threaded parts, and corrosion.&#xA0;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;They use top-of-the-line magnets and screens. The magnets they use are Neodymium Diametrically Magnetized Cylindrical Rare Earth Magnets which create a triple layer of Nickel and Copper to prevent against corrosion and abuse. Santa Cruz Shredder uses T304 Microbic Precision Woven Non-Fraying Stainless Steel Screens which has a high micron size that allows less impurities to pass through into the pollen chamber.

To add to their numerous benefits, titanium nails have superb heat retention and are very easy to use. Just heat them with a butane torch, then use a dabber or dab tool to place your concentrates on the nail. Rather than combust like dry herbs or tobacco, the essential oils vaporize and the vapor travels through the dab rig as you inhale."

After the standard process of heating up your domeless nail and adding the concentrates to it, immediately place your carb cap on top of it. Carb caps have a hole that provides ventilation and airflow while acting as a cover to ensure no vapor escapes. The added airflow gives great heat retention while also providing a low temperature dab hit. \r Glass Domes → Glass domes come with standard glass, quartz, ceramic, and titanium nails. While the nail goes inside the joint, the glass dome goes over the joint and the nail. The purpose of glass domes is to confine vapor once concentrates are added to the heated nail. The design of domes ensures vapor doesn’t escape into the air and is instead all inhaled into the concentrate pipe."
